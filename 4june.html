            objectives. Here are some common types of sitemaps.</h5> <br>


        <h6>HTML Sitemap</h6>

        <p>An HTML sitemap is primarily for website visitors. It's a human-readable page that lists all the pages on a
            website, typically organized in a hierarchical manner. HTML sitemaps serve as an additional navigation tool,
            helping users find content quickly, especially if the website's main navigation is complex or if the website
            has a large number of pages.</p> <br>

            with additional metadata such as the last time each page was modified and its importance relative to other
            pages on the site. XML sitemaps help search engines discover and index website content more efficiently.
